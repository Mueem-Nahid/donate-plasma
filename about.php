			<hr class="red-bar">
			<p>
				Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from patients who have recovered from the novel
				coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients develop antibodies in the blood
				against the virus. Antibodies are proteins that might help fight the infection. Convalescent plasma is being
				investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is no approved treatment for this disease and there is
				some information that suggests it might help some patients recover from COVID-19.

			<h2 class="text-center">I Have Fully Recovered From COVID-19. Am I Eligible to Donate Plasma?</h2>
			<hr class="red-bar">
			<p>
			 People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma,
			 which may help save the lives of other patients. COVID-19 convalescent plasma must only be collected from recovered
			 individuals if they are eligible to donate blood. Individuals must have had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented
			 by a laboratory test and meet other donor criteria. Individuals must have complete resolution of symptoms for at
			 least 14 days prior to donation. A negative lab test for active COVID-19 disease is not necessary to qualify for
			 donation.
